Genre Classification of DEAM - The MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis of Music

## Data
The data can be downloaded from [DEAM](http://cvml.unige.ch/databases/DEAM/)

Data size: 1.3 Gb

## Exploratory Analysis 

Check if songs belonging to different genres have different spectrograms that can be used to classify songs. 
Due to memory constraints, take a particular portion of songs for each genre and use them to plot spectrogram.

To get the genres of the songs in the dataset, download the metadata file from the link. For exploratory analysis,
take 10 songs from each genre and from each of these songs, take the portion from 10-15 and paste them together. 

This will give us one audio clip for each genre. Plot spectrograms.
